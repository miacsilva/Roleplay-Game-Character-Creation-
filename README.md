# Roleplay Game Character Creation

My task was creating the foundational classes to represent the Player character, that is, the
entity within the game world that the user of the game software would control. A role-playing game or
RPG is a game in which you take on the persona (sometimes also called the avatar) of an in-game
character, who goes on quests, fights enemies, looks for gold, crawls through dungeons or any other
number of tasks, depending on the game.
